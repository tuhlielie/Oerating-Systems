  One function of an operating system that I feel is very important is file management. Your operating system determines
how you can organize all of your files. When it comes to working with patient documents or if you are a photographer and need
to organize photos from different shoots, flexibility and ease of use are very important when it comes to file management.

   Another important function of an operating system is device management. I am a fan of Mac/Apple products because of the 
versatility between different devices. Apple products make sharing information and different files easy ebtween my watch
cell phone and computer.

  One of the most basic and overlooked functions of an operating software is the security. Generally everyday we log into our 
computers we use a password to gain access to our profile. These passwords prevent unauthorized users form gaining important 
information stored on our computers and devices.
